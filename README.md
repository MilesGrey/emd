An implementation of Squared Earth-Mover's Distance loss for Neural Networks described in [arXiv:1611.05916](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05916) [cs.CV].


Experiments can be run by calling the functions in `run.py`. Example scripts are given with `run_script1.py`, `run_script2.py`, `run_script3.py`.
